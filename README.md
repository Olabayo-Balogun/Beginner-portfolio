# Beginner-portfolio
This contains all the projects I have worked in my recent journey into the world of software engineering, I'm excited by the prospect of learning more and over the coming weeks I will be uploading more content.
The portfolio involves html,css and c# code.
For now I will be honing my html and css afterwhich I'll be moving to JS and finally c#.
By next year I plan to enter mobile development with Java and Kotlin.
Feel free to suggest projects that I can work on to hone my skills. Thank you.
